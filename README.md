Student Commute Optimizer  ðŸš—â€“ A full-stack carpooling and route-sharing app for students.


## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
The **Student Commute Optimizer** is a carpooling and route-sharing application designed for students.  
Instead of commuting individually, students can **share rides** efficiently by matching routes.

**How it works:**

**Frontend (Student Interface):**
- Students enter their **home location** and **destination** (school/college).  
- Displays **nearby students** traveling in the same direction.  
- Students can click on another student to **start a chat** (anonymous).  

**Backend (System Operations):**
- Compares multiple student routes.  
- Identifies **overlaps or proximity** in travel paths.  
- Suggests **possible carpooling matches**.  
- Each student has a **unique anonymous username** (cannot be duplicated).

## âš¡ Features
- Anonymous login with **auto-generated unique usernames**  
- Enter home and destination for commute  
- View **nearby students** on similar routes  
- Click to chat with nearby students (basic UI implemented in MVP)  
- Lightweight and simple **MVP ready for 90-minute submission**
